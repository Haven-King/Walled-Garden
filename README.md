# Walled Garden
A walled garden is a garden enclosed by high walls for horticultural rather than security purposes. Similarly, while Walled Garden can be used to keep people with or without certain mods from joining your server, it would not be difficult for a hostile actor to bypass.

## Setup
Walled Garden must be installed on both the client and the server.

For detailed setup instructions please see [the wiki](https://github.com/Hephaestus-Dev/Walled-Garden/wiki/Setup-and-Usage).
